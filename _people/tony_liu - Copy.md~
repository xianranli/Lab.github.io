### About Me

Hello! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, jointly advised by Konrad Kording and Lyle Ungar. Prior to UPenn, I graduated from Williams College in 2016 with a degree in Computer Science and spent two years at IBM Watson Health working as a software engineer.

I'm interested in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, specifically in applications to healthcare. I also dabble in all things CS.
