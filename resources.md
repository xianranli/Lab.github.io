### SciNet High-Performance Computing clusters
Our research significantly benefits from the computational power provided by USDA-ARS [SciNet](https://scinet.usda.gov/)
##### Ceres
More than 9000 compute cores (18000 logical cores) with 110 terabytes (TB) of total RAM, 500TB of total local storage, and 3.7 petabyte (PB) of shared storage.
Shared storage consists of 2.3PB high-performance Lustre space, 1.4PB high-performance BeeGFS space and 300TB of backed-up ZFS space.

##### Altas
11,520 2.40GHz Xeon Platinum 8260 processor cores, 101 terabytes of RAM, 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, and a Mellanox HDR100 InfiniBand interconnect. Atlas has a peak performance of 565 TeraFLOPS.

### Cool Molecular biology equipment
#### QIAxcel Advanced (Automatic gel electrophoresis)

The QIAxcel Advanced system fully automates sensitive, high-resolution capillary electrophoresis of up to 96 samples per run. DNA fragment analysis of 12 samples can be performed in as little as 3 minutes. Ready-to-run gel cartridges allow 96 samples to be analyzed with a minimum of hands-on interaction, reducing manual handling errors and eliminating the need for tedious gel preparation.

#### ProteinSimple Jess (Automatic Western blotting)

[<img src="/images/others/Jess.jpg" style="float: right; width: auto; height: 150px;">](https://www.proteinsimple.com/jess.html)
Automation of protein separation and immunodetection eliminates many of the tedious, error-prone steps of traditional Western blotting which limit data quality. Just load your samples and reagents into the microplate and Jess separates your proteins by size, and precisely manages antibody additions, incubations, washes and even the detection steps. Come back to fully analyzed western blotting results on 24 samples in 3 hours.
